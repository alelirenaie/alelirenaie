### About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Aleli Renaie Ilagan, a passionate Machine Learning Analyst student in Edmonton, Canada. With a background in Financial Management, I'm on a mission to leverage data-driven techniques for solving real-world problems and enhancing business outcomes.

ðŸ§  My toolbox includes technical skills in Python, SAP, MySQL, R, and Microsoft Office, complemented by soft skills such as effective communication, time management, teamwork, and unwavering attention to detail.

ðŸŒŸ Currently, I'm a Night Auditor at the River Cree Resort & Casino, ensuring smooth end-of-day operations, balancing reports, and addressing guest needs professionally. I am also still a part-time crew at McDonald's, where I usually manage drive-thru operations and ensure customer satisfaction.

ðŸ’¼ I also have experience as a Project Payables Technician at Fluor Daniel, Inc., where I managed project-related finances and effectively communicated with various stakeholders. During my tenure at the Bank Of the Philippine Islands, I facilitated daily financial services and maintained positive relationships with clients and vendors.

ðŸŽ“ I'm currently pursuing a Machine Learning Analyst Diploma at NorQuest College, where I am actively engaged as an RBC Student Ambassador, a member of the Academic Council, a SANCQ Volunteer, and part of NorQuest Esports Female Varsity Team

ðŸ“š In my free time, I love to engage in new learning experiences. Let's connect and collaborate and make data-driven magic happen!
